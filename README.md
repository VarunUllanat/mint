  Learning the language of protein-protein interactions with PLM-Multimer
</h1>

## Overview of PLM-Multimer

PLM-Multimer is a Protein Language Model (PLM) specifically designed to model sets of interacting proteins in a contextual and scalable manner. Using unsupervised training on a large curated PPI dataset derived from the STRING database, PLM-Multimer significantly outperforms existing PLMs in six diverse tasks, including binding affinity prediction and estimation of mutational effects. Beyond these core capabilities, it excels at modeling complex protein assemblies and surpasses specialized models in antibody-antigen modeling and T cell receptorâ€“epitope binding prediction. PLM-Multimer's predictions of mutational impacts on oncogenic PPIs align with experimental studies and provide reliable estimates for the potential for cross-neutralization of antibodies against SARS-CoV-2 variants of concern. These findings position PLM-Multimer as a powerful tool for elucidating complex protein interactions, with significant implications for biomedical research and therapeutic discovery.
