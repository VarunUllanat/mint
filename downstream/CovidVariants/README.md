## ESM-MULTIMER predicts antibody cross-neutralization against SARS-CoV-2 variants

For this analysis, you would need to download and prepare dataset splits as instructed in `prepare_data.ipynb`. Then, use `train.py` to run the training pipeline and predict probabilites on unseen variants. Finally, you can use `calculate_metrics.ipynb` to see how well the model did.
