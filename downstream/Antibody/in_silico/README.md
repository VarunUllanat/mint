## Performance on antibody modeling tasks (Desautels et al.)

Download the in-silico antibody dataset from the Desautels et al. [paper](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.04.03.024885v1.supplementary-material). You will also need the anti-SARS m396 Antibody sequence provided in this folder (`rcsb_pdb_2G75.fasta`). Finally, run `finetune_in_silico.py` to evaluate the model on this task.
